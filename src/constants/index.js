Divyansh is like my trusty sidekick, Weasel. Except instead of helping me with my merc work, he helps me with my website. And let me tell you, he is just as good at making me look good on the internet as Weasel is at making me look good in person. I mean, have you seen my website? It is like a work of art, folks! Divyansh is like a digital Picasso, minus the beret and the pretentiousness. So if you need a website that will make you look good, and maybe even make you laugh, then Divyansh is your guy! Just dont ask him to break the fourth wall, or he might just get stuck in the code like I do in my own head.'
